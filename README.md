Random Python Codes during Summer!
 - ### git_diff:
        Find the difference between two lines without using difflib.
 - ### divinesoup:
        Scrape the contents of (<div> tag of a specific class attribute) OR any tag (e.g- <p>).
        This gives the content without whitespaces in stdout. To use this, go to a website select part of 
        the contents and check the tag (with Inspect Element). Run the code and get the scraped contents!
